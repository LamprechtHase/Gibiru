I barely can't believe that Gibiru does not feature a dark theme and there is no userstyle to fix this.
This is why I coded some very simple dark theme for Gibiru, which as of now is my default search engine because I don't like to have my search results censored.
This works best together with Stylus (https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), because Stylus allows the user to conveniently change colors.
The CSS also can be used without Stylus, but changing colors is not as convenient then.
This is how the default dark color theme looks like:
![Gibiru dark theme](Gibiru_dark_theme.png?raw=true "Gibiru with dark userstyle")
